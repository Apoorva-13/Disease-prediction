# Disease-prediction
Analyzed breast cancer data using three classification techniques (Decision tree, KNN, Random Forest) to predict the occurrence of cancer and then compare their results.\
The number and size of medical databases are increasing rapidly but most of these data are not analyzed for finding the valuable and hidden knowledge. Advanced data mining techniques can be used to discover hidden patterns and relationships. Models developed from these techniques are useful for medical practitioners to make right decisions.
This is a project on Disease (Breast Cancer) Prediction, in which we use different algorithms for classifying between the Malignant and Benign cases. We are using a dataset that can be downloaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
We will first create a model, train that model, then we create a confusion matrix to check the accuracy of our model. 
Machine learning is widely used in bio informatics and particularly in breast cancer diagnosis. In this project, we have used certain classification methods like :
1. Decision Trees
2. K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) 
3. Random Forests	\

Our Goal of this project will be to analyze breast cancer data using three classification techniques to predict the occurrence of the cancer and then compare the results.\\
